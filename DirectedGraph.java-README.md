# Minimum Binary Heap

# METHODS:
- ADDNODE
    - in: unique id number of the node (0 or greater), unique string label for name
    - return: boolean
        - returns false if node number is not unique, or less than 0
        - returns false if label is not unique (or is null)
        - returns true if node is successfully added 
- ADDEDGE:
    - in: unique id number for the new edge, 
        - label of source node,
        - label of destination node,
        - weight for new edge (use 1 by default)
        - label for the new edge (allow null)
    - return: boolean
        - false if edge # is not unique or less than 0
        - false if source node is not in the graph
        - false if destination node is not in the graph 
        - false if edge number is not unique or less than 0
        - false if source node is not in graph
        - false if destination node is not in graph
        - false is there already is an edge between these 2 nodes
        - returns true if edge is successfully added 
            
- DELNODE:
    - in: string (label for the node to remove)
    - return: boolean
        - false if node does not exist, true if node is found and successfully removed)
- DELEDGE:
    - in: string label for source node, string label for destination node
    - return: boolean
        - false if edge does not exist
        - true if edge is found and successfully removed
- NUMNODES:
    - in: nothing
    - return: integer 0 or greater
- NUM EDGES:
    - in: nothing
    - return: integer 0 or greater
        - reports how many edges are in the graph
